# Pacman Search Algorithms

This project implements classic search algorithms to help Pacman navigate mazes efficiently, find food, and reach target locations optimally.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to apply fundamental AI search algorithms in a grid-based environment. Pacman must navigate through mazes using different strategies, each with its strengths and limitations.

## Implemented Algorithms

- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explores as deep as possible before backtracking.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Expands nodes level by level for shortest-path guarantees.
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS):** Uses a priority queue to find the least-cost path.
- **A\* Search (A\*):** Enhances UCS with heuristics for faster, optimal solutions.

## How to Run the Search Agents

Test different search strategies by running:
- **DFS:**
  `python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=dfs`
- **BFS:**
  `python pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs -z 0.5`
- **UCS:**
  `python pacman.py -l mediumDottedMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=ucs`
- **A\*:**
  `python pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic`
- Use `-h ` for a list of available options:
  `python pacman.py -h`
- Run the autograder to test the given implementation:
  `python autograder.py`
